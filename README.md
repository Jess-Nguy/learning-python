# Description:
This is a repo that holds all personal work that was done when learning about python with matplot and other cool imports.
It goes over 2 topics, `Analytics and Metrics` and `Machine Learning`. Some of the folders will have outcome images of the graphs.
Some won't have any graphs or images but will print outcomes.
