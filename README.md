### Part B)
Testing Naive Bayes classification against 8 different representation of text.
word vs stem. Multinomial vs Bernoulli NB. word removal vs no word removal. With 3 different parameters: stemming, word removal, and N-gram.


## A4 (assignment 4)
Before running `assign_4b.py` unzip `flock compressed.zip` and move `Flocking.csv` to a4 root.

### Part A)
This program is designed to use perceptron learning alogrithm to classify numeric data on 4 different files to see if it's lineraly separable.

Q: Using the results you got, which
sets would you say are linearly separable and which are not linearly separable?
A: files 1 and 2 are linearly separable. 3 and 4 are linearly separable because the first 2 got 100% accuracy on testing and the others were less than 50% accuracy with test data.

### Part B)
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Swarm+Behaviour

This program is uses Flocking csv from the swarm behaviour dataset, student number generated data CSVs. It uses multi-layer perceptron to classify the dataset.
